# Contributing to rusty-amp

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This is a real-time audio DSP project written in Rust — contributions are welcome in all areas: sound design, new effects, amp/cabinet models, UI improvements, bug fixes, and preset additions.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danylokravchenko/rusty-amp
cd rusty-amp
cargo build
cargo run
```

Run with `--release` for realistic audio performance:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Code style

The project enforces strict Clippy lints. Before opening a PR:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Comments should only explain *why*, not *what*. Well-named identifiers carry the what.

## DSP conventions

The audio callback runs on a dedicated real-time thread. Code that touches the signal path must be **allocation-free and panic-free** at runtime.

- Process samples as `f32`
- Oversampled stages live inside `oversample.rs`; add new ones there
- Biquad filters are built with `biquad.rs` helpers; do not implement raw filter math inline
- The FMV tone stack is in `tonestack.rs` — reuse it for tube amp models
- Cabinet IRs are synthesized in-code (no external `.wav` files); see `cab/` for the pattern

### Adding a new DSP effect

Effects live in `src/dsp/effects/`. Each is a self-contained `struct` with a
`process` method; logic shared between several effects lives in
`src/dsp/effects/mod.rs` so the individual files stay focused on their *voicing*:

- `OnePoleLp` — the variable low-pass behind passive tone controls (TS, fuzz).
- `ThreeBandEq` — low-shelf / mid-peak / high-shelf trio shared by the pre-amp and
  parametric EQs.
- `db_to_lin` / `lin_to_db` — decibel conversions for dynamics stages.
- `param_changed` — the "did this knob move enough to rebuild coefficients?" test.
- `Oversampler::process(x, f)` (in `oversample.rs`) — runs a clipper closure at the
  oversampled rate; reuse it instead of re-writing the up/map/down loop.

To add one:

1. Create `src/dsp/effects/<effect>.rs` with a `struct` that holds state and a
   `process(sample: f32) -> f32` (or stereo equivalent) method. Reuse the shared
   helpers above rather than re-implementing tone LPs, EQ trios or dirty-checks.
2. Declare and re-export it in `src/dsp/effects/mod.rs`.
3. Add a field to `DspChain` and a line in `DspChain::process` using the
   `mono_stage!` / `stereo_stage!` macro (in `src/dsp/mod.rs`) so it bypasses
   cleanly and reads its knobs from the shared `Params`.
4. Add the `Params` fields + defaults in `src/dsp/mod.rs` — the per-knob
   `Arc<AtomicF32>` values **and** the `<fx>_enabled: Arc<AtomicBool>` bypass flag
   (the macro stage and the UI both read it).
5. In `src/ui/config.rs`, add the knob-range constants (`<FX>_START` / `<FX>_END`)
   and the matching `KNOBS` entries. Keep them in the same top-to-bottom order as
   the rest — `←`/`→` navigation walks the `KNOBS` array linearly, so the order
   *is* the on-screen layout.
6. Register the pedal in the `PEDALS` table (also `src/ui/config.rs`): one entry
   with its name, livery colour (add a `PEDAL_<NAME>` colour to `src/ui/styles.rs`),
   knob range, and `enabled`-flag accessor. The rig tile grid, the detail editor,
   the `+ ADD` picker, and `D`-to-remove all derive from this table — no `draw.rs`
   layout code is needed.
7. Add the pedal's `enabled` flag to the `toggle_pedal` match in `src/ui/input.rs`
   so `Space` can bypass it while it's on the board.
8. Add preset fields in `src/preset.rs` (including the on/off state so a preset can
   place the pedal on the board — `sync_board` reads the enabled flags after load).
9. Add a `#[cfg(test)]` module in the effect file — every effect carries unit tests
   (finite/bounded output, and that each knob moves the band/level it should).

### Adding a new amp model

Amp models live in `src/dsp/amp/`. Each model is a struct that implements the gain stages, tone stack call, sag, and speaker interaction. Use the existing Marshall or Mesa files as a template.

Register the new model in the `AmpModel` enum and match arms in `src/dsp/amp/mod.rs`, then add a `[C]` cycle entry in `src/ui/input.rs` and a label in `src/ui/draw.rs`.

### Adding a new cabinet model

Cabinet models live in `src/dsp/cab/`. Each model synthesizes its own IR (voiced EQ skeleton + comb reflections + modal resonances). Follow the existing Mesa/Marshall/Orange pattern.

Register in the `CabinetModel` enum and cycle logic.

## Adding a bundled preset

Drop a `.toml` file in `presets/`. Follow the schema in the README — all fields are optional except `name`. Test it by running the app and pressing `P`.

Bundled presets cannot be deleted by users, so only add presets that are genuinely useful and well-tuned.

## Testing

The DSP path has a unit-test suite — every effect, amp and cabinet model carries
`#[cfg(test)]` tests covering stability (finite, bounded output) and behaviour
(each control moves the band/level it should). Run them with:

```bash
cargo test
```

New DSP code must come with tests in the same file, and they run on every commit in
CI. There are no automated tests for rendering and controls yet, so the UI still
needs manual testing:

1. `cargo run --release` with an audio interface connected
2. Verify the effect under test across the full gain range
3. Confirm no audible clicks or artifacts when toggling bypass or switching models
4. Confirm the preset round-trips correctly (save → reload → values match)

## Submitting a PR

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your change — keep scope tight, one logical change per PR
3. Run `cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and fix any issues
4. Open a PR against `main` with a short title and a description of *why* the change is needed
5. Include a brief note on how you tested it
